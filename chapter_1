#norm distrbution 
#dmorn will create a normal distrbution 
y <- dnorm(Sampledata$Return, mean = mean(Sampledata$Return, sd = sd(Sampledata$Return, na.rm = FALSE)) 
plot(Sampledat$Return, y) 


#pnorm is know as the cumulative distribution function 
pnorm(.02, mean = mean(Sampledata$Return), sd = sd(Sampledata$Return, na.rm = FALSE) 
#this yields 0.159837 and can be interpreted as there is a 16% prob of getting a return greater than 2% 


#qnorm takes a prob value and returns a number for which the cumulative value matches the prob and the function is defined as follows 
#qnorm(x, mean, sd) 

qnorm(0.159837, mean = mean(Sampledata$Return), sd = +sd(Sampledata$Return, na.rm = FASLE), lower.tail = FALSE) 

#this gives us an output 0.02, which means that for the return of greater than equal 2% the prob is 16% 

#rnorm is used to generate random numbers 

rnorm(5, mean = mean(Sampledat$Reutrn), sd = +sd(Sampledata$Return, na.rm = FALSE) 


#in a fincial time series, the lornormal distrbuction plays a more critical role than the noraml distrbution 
#dlnorm(x, meanlog, sdlog) 
#this find the log density function 
y <- dlnorm(Sampledata$Volume, mealog= mean(Sampledata$Volume, sdlog = sd(Sampledata$Volume, na.rm = FALSE)) > 
plot(Sampledata$Volume, y) 

#find volume CDF 

y <- plnorm(Sampledata$Volume, meanlog = mean(Sampledata$Volume, na.rm = FSE)) > 
plot(Sampledata$Volume, y) 


plnorm is used to generate p quantillies of te lognormal distrbution, which can be done by the following syntax 
qlnorm(p, mean, standard devation) 

rlnorm generates a dataset with a given mean and standard devation. 
rlnorm(n, mean, standard dev) 


Poisson Distrbution is the probability distrbution of the occurrence of independent events in an interval.
